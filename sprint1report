## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synopsis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't
repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand
how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any
significant learnings for your team.

For this sprint our team determined and implemented the various roles a user can take in the Dine Auto program. This is either customer, restaurant employee or owner. For features 1-3, we each took on a user role and implemented account created and login for each. A barrier we overcame is learning a new language and framework for web development (C# and html). Overall, we learned how to make a local website with json storage for input data.

## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user
stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward
completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of
acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the
issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate
it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so
that it can be addressed later.
So far, the page for an owner to add and manage a restaurant is not connected to the UI (not accessible by end user yet)

(Based the issues/bugs in kanban) need integration, redirections, etc.

## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
* URL of restaurant catalogue while this is mostly complete, there is a disconnect between this and the implementation of modify restaurant.

* https://github.com/bcaitlyn/CPTS322_DineAutoProject/issues/13 - (applies to all user logins) has bugs related to login states, due to lack of time this bug was not fixed.

* https://github.com/users/bcaitlyn/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=102428872&issue=bcaitlyn%7CCPTS322_DineAutoProject%7C29 - While the setup for the owner to register a restaurant is complete there is no way to track which owner created which restaurant. This can be fixed in the next sprint by modifying the .txt to include the owner's credentials to know who created it.
