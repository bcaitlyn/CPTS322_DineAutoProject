Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Overall our team worked on the commerce aspect of the project, including a UI for browsing and functionality for ordering and paying. We mostly divided up the work based on what we worked on for sprint 1, for example members who worked on owner login for sprint 1 worked on more features for restaurant owners for this sprint. We learned how to manage many branches in github and how to resolve merge conflicts by communicating as a team.
Unfinished Work
No unfinished work. Everyone got their assigned feature done.
